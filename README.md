The controls work as follows:

- **Run**: Choose a root directory to recursively search for files that cannot be validated as images.

- **Abort**: Stop searching the directory.

- **Extensions**: Specify a comma-separated list of extensions on which to attempt validation.

- **Save**: Output the paths of any invalid images found to a text document.
